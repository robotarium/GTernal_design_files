If looking to purchase circuit boards, this link may hold an up to date CircuitHub order: https://circuithub.com/projects/Payday02/GTernal/revisions/51452/parts

Link to slightly older version with more testing: https://circuithub.com/projects/Payday02/Gritsbot-3/revisions/50001/parts

If looking for a BOM, it can be found in the Parts Folder or here on google sheets (Google sheets may likely be more up to date than the parts folder as parts go in and out of circulation) https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fcbRilmKaX-AO9ylUm2N9gINN3ZsyIf4CjUE0T1iR2c/edit?usp=sharing
